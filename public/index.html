      The placeholder %PUBLIC_URL% will be replaced with the actual URL of the 
      `public` folder during the build process. This allows files within the public folder 
      to be accessed correctly in both development and production environments.

      Using "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" ensures that the favicon will load correctly
      in cases where the app is served from a non-root public URL.
